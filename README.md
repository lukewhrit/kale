Kale is a modern multi-purpose Discord bot written in Golang. Kale is still heavily work in progress and is not usable quite yet.

Kale was designed to be the perfect bot for my communities, and I hope it can be for yours too. It's best utilized in small-medium sized communities as it's moderation system may not be advanced enough for larger communities. 

Kale contains a lot of features, here's a brief overview:

 * Powerful moderation.
 * A unique social system.
 * Mod Mail.
 * Reaction Roles.
 * Simple Reminders.
 * Automatic URL safety checking.
 * Starboards and strawpolls.
 * Member count channels.
 * And so much more.

The infrastructure and technology used to build Kale was decided upon with extreme scrutiny to ensure Kale is as stable, fast, and maintainable as possible. Kale uses a Redis-cached instance of PostgreSQL for it's database, Golang for it's programming language, and the libraries [discordgo](github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) and [shireikan](github.com/zekroTJA/shireikan) for interacting with Discord.
